FireStrike - A decentralized anonymous file-sharing network built on TOR infrastructure. The project combines DHT (Distributed Hash Table) technology with strong encryption to provide secure and private file exchange without central servers.

Key Features:
- Full anonymity through TOR network
- End-to-end AES-256-CBC encryption
- Decentralized storage using DHT
- Convenient magnet links (firestrike://<hash>#<key>)
- Command-line interface for easy file operations
- No registration or central servers required

Technical Stack:
- Python 3.8+ async implementation
- TOR hidden services for P2P connections
- SHA3-256 for file hashing
- NaCl for asymmetric encryption
- Stem library for TOR control
- Automated testing with pytest

Security Features:
- No IP address exposure
- Client-side encryption
- Secure key exchange
- Automatic file chunking
- Safe temporary file handling

Perfect for:
- Private file sharing
- Decentralized storage
- Secure data transfer
- Anonymous communication
